Welcome to my blog!
On this blog I will be going over topics that are currently at the bleeding-edge
of research in the life sciences. I will particularly be focusing on the topic of 
computational methods for the advancement of drug discovery. Aside from that, I will
also be sharing my knowledge on topics such as the application of software engineering
and data science within e.g. clinical trials.

With this blog, I aim to inspire others to pursue this field of research, and also show the
importance of computational approaches in the pursuit of improved healthcare.
